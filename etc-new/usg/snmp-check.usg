[host]

This script checks if SNMP is active or not and SNMP responds
in orderly fashion. If the script is run interactively (as in
 from command line) result is echoed.

If you provide the script with [host] equal to hostname -s [thus 
running script against localhost or the machine you are currently
on] script will restart snmp daemon if not currently running (or
SNMP error detected).
